My name is Vlad, I'm a Software Developer living in Stockholm.

Some notable things I made:

- [Cljfx](https://github.com/cljfx/cljfx) — reactive JavaFX wrapper for Clojure

I work on [Defold](https://defold.com/) editor. I like plants — I have a cherry tree on a balcony. My favorite video game is Deltarune. My most played video game is Fortnite.
