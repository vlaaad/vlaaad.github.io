Reveal can show you documentation and sources for various runtime values â€” namespaces, vars, symbols, functions, keywords (if they define a spec). Like [cljdoc](https://cljdoc.org/), it supports `[[wikilink]]` syntax in docstrings to refer to other vars, making them accessible for further exploration.
