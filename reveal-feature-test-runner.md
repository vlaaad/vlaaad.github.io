From individual vars to the whole suite, you can use Reveal for running tests and quickly navigating the structured test output. When defining new tests, you can use `test` contextual action to test the var (or the whole ns). You can also use test runner sticker for an always-on UI for running tests. Jump between errors instantly using <kbd>Alt ↑</kbd> and <kbd>Alt ↓</kbd> in test output. Use `diff` contextual action on test failures to see the difference between expected and actual values:
