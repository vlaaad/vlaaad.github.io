Clojure 1.10 added `tap>` function with the purpose similar to printing the value for debugging, but instead of characters you get the object. Reveal REPLs show tapped values in their output windows â€” you won't need `println` anymore!

If you don't want to use Reveal as a REPL output pane, you can instead use `(r/tap-log)` to show tapped values in a separate window.
