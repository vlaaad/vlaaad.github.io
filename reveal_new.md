# Overview

Reveal is a Clojure-oriented data inspection toolbox that aims to remove the barrier between you and objects in your VM. 

The goals of Reveal are:
- to empower you to hold a value in your hand — meaning you can look at it from different angles, pick it apart and analyze different pieces of the data just by pointing at them;
- to complement REPL-aided development — providing both interactive output panes for the REPL and tools to use at the REPL;
- to get the most from being in-process — in addition to working with remote processes.

There are 2 versions of Reveal:
- Reveal Free: FOSS, [sponsored on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/vlaaad);
- Reveal Pro: $9.99 per month, [start a free trial here](https://buy.stripe.com/8wM9Dz5bKand5ck3cc){: .buy-button}. For residents and citizens of Ukraine Reveal Pro is free forever — use "PUTINKHUILO" promocode during checkout.

# Reveal in media

I gave 3 talks about Reveal:
- [Reclojure 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq-7aiXPRKs), 24 minutes;
- [Reclojure 2021 data science special: visual tools](https://youtu.be/lqb4XlFI-08?t=1220), 10 minutes;
- [Scicloj meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm7LoqvaYXk), 2 hours including Q&A, cljfx and live demo.

Other videos about Reveal:
- [Practicalli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jy09_16EeY) demo, 5 minutes;
- [REPL Driven Development, Clojure's Superpower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIoadGfm5T8) by Sean Corfield (1h15m), not about Reveal per se, but uses Reveal extensively.

I also talked about Reveal on [defn](https://soundcloud.com/defn-771544745/65-vlad-protsenko) podcast (1h30m).

Various written setup instructions using Reveal:
- [Practicalli](https://practical.li/clojure/clojure-cli/data-browsers/reveal.html) page describes Reveal setup for CLI, nrepl editors, emacs (using cider) and rebel-readline;
- [Calva](https://calva.io/reveal/) page describes vscode setup with Calva extension (using both tools-deps and leiningen examples);
- my [blog post](/reveal-repls-and-networking) describes various Reveal socket REPL setups that talk with remote processes.

# Closing thoughts

If repl is a window to a running program, then Reveal is an open door — and you are welcome to come in. I get a lot of leverage from the ability to inspect any object I see, and I hope you will find Reveal useful too.

If you do, please consider supporting my work either by [sponsoring the development](https://github.com/sponsors/vlaaad) of the free version or by [buying the subscription](https://buy.stripe.com/8wM9Dz5bKand5ck3cc){: .buy-button} for Pro version.
