You are required to pay a subscription fee to use Reveal Pro. You agree to provide current, complete, and accurate purchase and account information for Reveal Pro.

Sales tax will be added to the price of purchases as deemed required by me. I may change prices at any time. All payments shall be in U.S. dollars. You consent to my charging your payment method on a recurring basis without requiring your prior approval for each recurring charge until you notify me of your cancellation. I reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes in pricing, even if I have already requested or received payment.
