There are cases where it is better to make sense of the value when it is represented by a table: collections of homogeneous items where columns make it easier to compare corresponding parts of those items, and big deeply nested data structures where it's easier to look at them layer by layer.

Note: You can use `Alt ↑` and `Alt ↓` to sort table by values in selected column; and `Ctrl C` will copy cell content as text.
